                Sequel Rails Migrations
                    for Rails 2.3

Sequel provides a powerful API and platform for many things, but its migrations
aren't a great fit for Rails 2.3 out of the box.  Unfortunately, the upgrade to
Rails 3 is a large undertaking for existing applications, and often you'd like
to use Sequel sooner than that.

You also have a lot of ActiveRecord migrations in your existing application,
and you don't especially want to port them to Sequel.

This project can help.

Installing
----------
This is a .rake file to be included in a Rails 2.3 project under
the lib/tasks directory.

Your Sequel migrations should *not* simply be included in the db/migrate
directory with your older ActiveRecord migrations!  Instead, create
a db_migrations directory under the Rails project root and put your
Sequel migrations there.  If you'd prefer a different directory,
search for "db_migrations" in the .rake file -- put the directory
where you want it.  Bear in mind that you do need the "../.." in
the path because the Rakefile is installed into lib/tasks.

Using
----------
The included .rake file will override standard Rails tasks like
db:migrate, db:rollback and db:version.  As usual, you can use
"rake -T" to get a list of available rake targets.  Any additional
targets added by this rakefile should be run automatically when
needed.
